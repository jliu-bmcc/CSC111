## Question 1

Develop a C++ program for a basic calculator with four functionalities: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should prompt the user to input two numbers and select an operation using the corresponding letter (e.g., 'A' for addition). Utilize `switch` statements to check the operation selected by the user. After performing the chosen operation, the program should display the result.


## Question 2

Write a program that asks the user to enter today’s sales for five stores. The program should then display a bar graph comparing each store’s sales. Create each bar in the bar graph by displaying a row of asterisks. Each asterisk should represent $100 of sales.

Here is an example of the program’s output.

```
Enter today's sales for store 1: 1000 [Enter]
Enter today's sales for store 2: 1200 [Enter]
Enter today's sales for store 3: 1800 [Enter]
Enter today's sales for store 4: 800 [Enter]
Enter today's sales for store 5: 1900 [Enter]

(Each * = $100)
Store 1: **********
Store 2: ************
Store 3: ******************
Store 4: ********
Store 5: *******************
